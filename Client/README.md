> [!WARNING]
> If Wireguard is still working on your internet, use Chain config otherwise use CDN
> (Chain config has been tested and works on internet providers: Irancell, Asiatech, Zi-tel and Mobinnet)

>[!CAUTION]
>For chain config :
>For each device you must get different warp wireguard config, cloudflare confused the same warp wireguard configuration on different devices (it causes not connecting or experiencing low speed)

>[!NOTE]
>You can use Vless instead of vmess, use websocket transfer instead of httpUpgrade. but you have to apply these changes on the server as well
In my experience (Iran), vmess and httpUpgrade work better and have a higher security factor
